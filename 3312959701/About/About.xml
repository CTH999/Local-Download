This mod is meant to be used as a replacement for the full JecsTools suite when using "A RimWorld of Magic".
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1201382956

It contains the JecsTools components required for RWoM, and nothing else:

AbilityUser
AbilityUserAI
CompDeflector
CompLumbering
CompOversizedWeapon

Please note that these come directly from JecsTools without modification.
With this you'll at least be running a little lighter - no need to load a bunch of code you aren't going to use anyway.

Thanks to Jecrell for JecsTools, Torann for A RimWorld of Magic, and to Roque the Rogue for testing.

FAQ:

Q: RWoM reports JecsTools not found, why?
A: You can ignore that; RWoM looks for the full JecsTools. This mod provides all the JecsTools components required by RWoM.

Q: Does this mod replace Hugslib as well?
A: No.

Q: Are these components updated/optimized/improved?
A: No. They come directly from the 1.5 version of JecsTools.

Q: Can you fix x, y, and z?
A: No. This is simply a replacement for the full JecsTools as a pre-req for A RimWorld of Magic. You should contact Torann regarding issues with RWoM. Any existing issues in the JecsTools code will remain as I source directly from the 1.5 version of that mod.
